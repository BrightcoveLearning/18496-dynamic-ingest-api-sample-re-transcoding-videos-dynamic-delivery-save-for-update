# 18496-dynamic-ingest-api-sample-re-transcoding-videos-dynamic-delivery-save-for-update
In this sample, you will learn how to retranscode multiple videos using the Dynamic Ingest API. To get access tokens and make the API calls, it uses a proxy built by Brightcove Learning services.  Note that this sample is for Dynamic Delivery accounts. If your account uses the legacy ingest system, see this version instead.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:
