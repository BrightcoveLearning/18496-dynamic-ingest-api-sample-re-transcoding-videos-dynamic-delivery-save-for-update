# 18496-dynamic-ingest-api-sample-re-transcoding-videos-dynamic-delivery-save-for-update
In this sample, you will learn how to retranscode multiple videos using the Dynamic Ingest API. To get access tokens and make the API calls, it uses a proxy built by Brightcove Learning services.  Note that this sample is for Dynamic Delivery accounts. If your account uses the legacy ingest system, see this version instead.
