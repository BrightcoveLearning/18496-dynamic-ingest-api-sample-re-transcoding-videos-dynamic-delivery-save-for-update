In this sample, you will learn how to retranscode multiple videos using the Dynamic Ingest API. To get access tokens and make the API calls, it uses a proxy built by Brightcove Learning services.  Note that this sample is for Dynamic Delivery accounts. If your account uses the legacy ingest system, see [this version](https://support.brightcove.com/dynamic-ingest-api-sample-re-transcoding-videos-legacy-ingest) instead.

This repository contains all the code for your convenience. There are both `src` and `dist` folders, but their contents are identical. We recommend you use the `dist` folder if you want to modify the code, so that you still have the original source.
